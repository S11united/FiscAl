            "\n",
            "1. **Revenue Growth**: Meta's revenue increased by 27% year-over-year (YoY) to $36.46 billion, driven by growth in ad impressions (20% YoY) and average price per ad (6% YoY).\n",
            "2. **Net Income and EPS**: Net income surged by 117% YoY to $12.37 billion, resulting in a diluted EPS of $4.71, up 114% YoY.\n",
            "3. **Operating Margin Expansion**: The operating margin expanded to 38% from 25% in Q1 2023, indicating improved profitability.\n",
            "4. **Strong Cash Generation**: Meta generated $12.53 billion in free cash flow, and its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance stood at $58.12 billion as of March 31, 2024.\n",

            "1. **Costs and Expenses**: While revenue grew 27% YoY, costs and expenses increased by only 6% YoY, which may indicate some cost discipline. However, the company expects full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, which could put pressure on margins.\n",
            "2. **Reality Labs**: The company expects operating losses in Reality Labs to increase meaningfully YoY due to ongoing product development efforts and investments to scale the ecosystem.\n",
            "3. **Capital Expenditures**: Meta expects full-year 2024 capital expenditures to be in the range of $35-40 billion, which is higher than its prior range of $30-37 billion. This could impact free cash flow generation.\n",
            "4. **Regulatory Headwinds**: The company faces increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US, which could significantly impact its business and financial results.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Guidance and Outlook:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Q2 2024 Revenue Guidance**: Meta expects total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion, with a 1% headwind from foreign currency exchange rates.\n",
            "2. **Full-Year 2024 Guidance**: The company expects full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, and capital expenditures to be in the range of $35-40 billion.\n",

            "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
